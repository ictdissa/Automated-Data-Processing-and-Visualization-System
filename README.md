✅ Data Cleaning – Removes duplicates and null values.
✅ ETL Pipeline – Uses Apache Spark to transform data before loading it into a database.
✅ Storage & Integration – Uploads cleaned data to AWS S3.
✅ Data Visualization – Interactive dashboards using Plotly.
✅ Logging & Error Handling – Monitors ETL operations with log files.
